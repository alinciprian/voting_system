Smart contract finished, fully working . Just a basic front end integration ar the moment. More to be done soon.

This project demonstrates a voting system implementation in Solidity.
The deployer of the contract is the "chairman" and only him can give any address the right to vote. The proposals are set in the constructor.

Each address that has been given rights by the chairman can vote or opt for delegating their vote to another address.Each vote is unique and irrevocable.

The chairman can opt to "count the votes" and display the winning proposal (or proposals if there is a tie)
